##I made this project to explore dev tools like Grunt and also learn more about back end development with node and mongodb.

**from the root of the project:**
- run npm install
- then run bower install

running ' grunt test ' will run the karma tests for you.

Final plan would be to get grunt to run all of your tests, then minify the code and so on, then start the server.
