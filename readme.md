##Penny Tracker is a full stack of applications which will help you keep track of your spending.

This is mainly for my experimentation. It is certainly not a finished product!

**from the root of the project:**
- run npm install
- then run bower install

running ' grunt test ' will run the karma tests for you.

Final plan would be to get grunt to run all of your tests, then minify the code and so on, then start the server.
